# Smidig_Prosjekt

Because of dependencies, this are the librarys and versions which will be needed to run the GUI.

1. Use the newest version of python, which will be Python 3.12.3 64-bit
link: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
2. Ensure you can run pip from the command line: py -m pip --version (NOT the same command for mac/linux) | MAC/Linux: python3 -m ensurepip --default-pip.
3. Ensure pip, setuptools, and wheel are up to date: py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel | Unix/macOS: python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
4. Install pillow, Windows: py -m pip install pillow | Unix/macOS: python3 -m pip install pillow.
5. Upgrade python packages if needed or using outdated versions, Windows: py -m pip install --upgrade "SomeProject" | Unix/macOS: python3 -m pip install --upgrade "SomeProject".

# Managing Application Dependencies
This will make sure everyone in a project are using the same packages and versions.

1. Install pipenv, Windows: py -m pip install --user pipenv | Unix/macOS: python3 -m pip install --user pipenv
2. Installing packages for your project. Pipenv will manage dependencies on a per-project basis. To install packages, change into your project's directory and run: cd "myproject"
pipenv install requests
3. Pipenv will install the Requests library and create a Pipfile for you in your projectâ€™s directory. The Pipfile is used to track which dependencies your project needs in case you need to re-install them, such as when you share your project with others. 
4. locate the folder where pipenv.exe, pipenv-reslover.exe and virtualenv.exe were downloaded, and add the folder containing these files to the PATH variable list. 
5. Using installed packages. In a .py file, import requests to use the modules in the requests file. read this link for more help: https://medium.com/@kevinmarkvi/how-to-add-executables-to-your-path-in-windows-5ffa4ce61a53
